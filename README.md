Aims to analyze various hitting and pitching stats for Major League Baseball (MLB), the league leaders for every year. Analysis of these metrics will serve as answers to our questions of interest. We would like to know how the National League (NL) leaders in various metrics compare over time. Through our big-picture question, we anticipate that we will also gain answers to how the statistics for the league leaders compare via year intervals, what certain peaks and valleys exist in our data, how some average-based statistics truly reflect upon the statistic itself (i.e., if the pitcher with the highest strikeouts per nine innings necessarily was the pitcher with the most strikeouts), and if we can draw a relationship between hitting and pitching metrics, especially over time. We plan to spotlight various MLB players through our investigation and analysis, while also acknowledging the impact of new technology on the collection of statistics over time. The purpose of investigating these questions is to work with a long-existing and ever-growing dataset that is meaningful to players, team officials, statisticians, and fans. These statistics and metrics are meant to determine the proficiency of performance and a playerâ€™s value to his team, further underscoring the importance of understanding the data.
